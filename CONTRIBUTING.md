## TypeScript Migration

We are currently in the process of migrating the code base partially to TypeScript.
All new files under `src` and `server` should be written in TypeScript.

All new features should be built using TypeScript.
Existing features can be ported over to TypeScript by adding changing the file extension from `.js` to `.ts`/`.tsx`.

In case you want to help porting features over to TypeScript, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
